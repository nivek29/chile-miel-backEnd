# Chile Miel API

_This proyect uses `NodeJS v14.x`_

To install the dependencies run

```
yarn
```

Then you need to apply the environment variables. To do it, you'll need either a linux/MAC/Gitbash console.

(You can download `GIT BASH` from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)).

Inside the Git bash console, run:

```
export $(cat .env.development | xargs)
```

_Note: you'll need to run the proyect in the same console as you run the previous command_

After applying the environenment variables run

```
yarn start
```
